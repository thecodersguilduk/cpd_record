# CPD Record for [Re]Boot

Copy this basic template and fill in your details from the course.

This code is _very_ basic - you should add additional markup like caption and scope to clarify and improve the semantics. More details on HTML tables can be found at MDN: [The Table element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table)

You could also add some styles with CSS.
